## Project Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. This project leverages machine learning to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of heart disease. The goal is to create a model that can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

## Technologies Used
Python
html (for the web application)
jupter notebook (for machine learning)


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains several health metrics for patients and indicates whether they have heart disease.

## 1.Installation
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/afifa17112005/heart-disease-prediction.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd heart-disease-prediction
```
Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
1.Run the Flask application:
```
python app.py
```
2.Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000.
3.Enter patient data into the form and submit to receive a prediction.
## How It Works
1.Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and processed to handle missing values and categorical data.
2.Model Training: Various machine learning models are trained on the dataset, including Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.
3.Prediction: The trained model predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user input.
